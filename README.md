# C-Cave-Story-Project
This is a proof of concept C++ project, using the SDL2 library to create a game engine and tmx to create the 2D bitmap. 
This will be updated throughout the Spring 2019 Semester for the Structural Programming/C++ course at ASUMH.


Cave Story was first introduced to me in the C++/structural programming class taught at ASUMH led by Michael Barnes. This is the first large scale OOP project. Original remake project idea is credited to Limeoats (YouTube and Reddit). The original game and assets are from a single developer, Doukutsu Monogatari in 2004. This project goes through game logic, game engine building, using sprites, using tiles and animating tiles.
